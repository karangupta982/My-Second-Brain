# Extension Icons

This directory should contain the extension icons in the following sizes:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

## Creating Icons

You can create these icons using any design tool. Here are some options:

### Option 1: Use an Online Icon Generator
1. Visit https://www.favicon-generator.org/
2. Upload a logo or image
3. Download the icons in different sizes
4. Rename them to match the required names above

### Option 2: Use Design Tools
- Figma, Canva, or Adobe Illustrator
- Create a simple brain/synapse icon
- Export in the required sizes

### Option 3: Placeholder Icons (Temporary)
For development, you can use simple colored squares:
1. Use any image editor
2. Create PNG files with solid colors
3. Save them in the sizes mentioned above

### Suggested Design
- Use a brain icon or neural network symbol
- Color scheme: Purple/Blue gradient (matching the app theme)
- Keep it simple and recognizable at small sizes

## Alternative (Using Emoji as Icon)

As a quick workaround during development, you can:
1. Take a screenshot of the 🧠 emoji
2. Resize it to the required dimensions
3. Use it as a placeholder until you create proper icons
